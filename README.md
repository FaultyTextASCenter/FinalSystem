## Overview

This repository represents the final phase of our project, where we integrate and implement the best-performing models to build a fully functional system. The focus is on evaluating the practical application of our models and ensuring they deliver accurate and reliable results in decoding obscure Korean text.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to compare the performance of various models developed during the experimental phase and implement the most effective one into a real-world system. This system will serve as a prototype, demonstrating the potential of our NLP technology.

## Future Direction

Once the Korean language system is fully operational, we plan to adapt and expand it to support other languages, enabling global applicability and inclusivity.

## Contents

- Finalized model integration and implementation scripts
- System architecture and deployment guidelines
- Performance comparison and analysis reports
- Demonstrations of the system in action
